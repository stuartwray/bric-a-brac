`convert-to-native-newlines.py` Reads text files and replaces newlines 
with whatever is native on this machine.

`correlations.py` Demonstrates that when we sum four independent random
variables, the correlation between their sum and any one of them is r = 0.5 
(Some people naively imagine that it is 0.25)

`fast-fib.py` Some implementations of the Fibonacci function, with a timing 
harness to benchmark them. Includes an interesting implementation based on
exercise 1.19 of SICP, which works like a a square-and-multiply exponentiator.

`mastermind-cc.cc` Invents a random mastermind position and solves it.

`mastermind.py` The same mastermind solver in Python. (Quite a bit slower.)

`match.c` A simple regexp matcher.

`match-continuation-passing.c` The same regexp matcher, but transformed 
into continuation-passing style. 

`monads-and-gonads.py` A python version of code from Douglas Crockford's
"Monads and Gonads" talk.

`problib.py` Utility functions for working with log-probabilities.

`redemo.py` The redemo program from the Python distribution, updated to work 
under Python3.

`tank-production.py` Uses `problib.py` to do Bayesian analysis on a 
tank-production problem from WW2.
